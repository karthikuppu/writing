I only want to work with people who are, or have the potential to be, great at what they do.

I'll need to be great myself in order to attract great teammates, therefore I see this essay as a personal north star: it defines the kind of person and teammate I aspire to become.

I seek the following qualities:

### Ambitious

Ambition is an innate craving to do great work and not settle for anything less. To push the frontier of our species. To do something that no one else has done before.

Ambition can be found anywhere: business, arts, sports, politics, parenting, health. There's opportunity for ambition in any human endeavor.

True ambition is rare. Most who claim to be ambitious only want to gain status that puts them "above" their peers. They're not actually committed to pushing the frontier. This is why many "ambitious" people end up in undifferentiated, mediocre, middle management roles.

I've yet to find an example of someone who wasn't ambitious become highly ambitious. They may exist, but because I haven't seen one, I operate with the belief that it's not possible to become highly ambitious from a low ambition starting point. You either have it or you don't. But, I have seen people who were only moderately ambitious become highly ambitious over time as they gained confidence in their abilities. I've also seen life beat ambition out of people. Protecting & cultivating ambition is a skill.

I want to work with ambitious people, with the skill to protect and cultivate their ambition, because they push me to dream bigger, and do better work.

### Determined

I want to work with people who have the mental fortitude to stick to the path, especially as it gets difficult - which it will.

### Has great judgement

The [power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law) exists everywhere: the best paths are orders of magnitude more fruitful than the next best ones - whether it's what you work on, who you marry, where you live, etc.

I want to work with people who not only have a knack of finding the right paths, but have also internalized the power law distribution in everything. When you've internalized that the power law exists everywhere, you become more hungry to find the best paths because you understand just how much better they are than the rest, and you also develop a healthy fear towards mediocrity.

There's also a power law distribution in which decisions matter. Finding the best option in everything is foolish, and frankly impossible. People with good judgement know which decisions they should be paranoid about finding the best path, and which ones they should quickly settle for "good enough" to not waste time.

Great judgement is invaluable.

### Limitless

All of us are limited by our identities to some degree. Someone who thinks of themselves as a "writer" tends to only see paths that reinforce that identity, and will find it difficult to explore opportunities that they don't see a writer doing.

This blindness isn't conscious. Our subconscious quickly gets attached to identities, and this attachment causes blindness towards things that don't support to what we're attached to.

Years ago, I was discussing a product idea with a "back-end" engineer. They were hesitant to work on it with me because they didn't feel they had the "front-end" ability to be able to pull it off well. This is one of the silliest ways to limit yourself and yet most people seem to find such silly reasons to avoid exploring something.

I want to work with people who are not limited by their identities, who have minds that can move freely between domains of knowledge or forms of expression.

Of course, it's nearly impossible for us to overcome our attachment towards identities. Which is why I think it's more productive to try and expand what you identify with, rather than trying to eliminate identifying altogether. Therefore, I want to work with people who identify with doing great work, or solving a particular problem, instead of something limiting like "engineer", "writer", "designer", etc.

### Writes well

I want to work with people who are clear & rigorous thinkers.

Writing isn't just a process to communicate what you've already thought about, it's the most potent form of thinking itself. How well you can write correlates strongly with how well you can think.

I care more about quality of writing than speaking (whether in front of an audience, or even in a team setting) because communicating well via speaking requires a set of skills that aren't necessary for thinking well. A great thinker can be a horrible speaker because they are shy, or their minds race too fast for their voice to keep up, or for other reasons. But, there is no excuse for poor, muddled writing.

Poor writing points to terrible judgement because poor writing is almost always caused by:

1. not prioritizing the value of communicating something well.
2. or, not giving yourself enough time and space to think things through, and get feedback.

Writing well enables strong collaboration. Poor communicators create the conditions for teams go out of sync: emotionally and intellectually.

I can't imagine working with someone who can't write well.

### Thinks long-term

I want to work with people who think in decades, or even centuries. Our work must endure the test of time. The greatest outcomes are a result of compounding. Compounding requires you to stick to something for long periods of time to reap its benefits.

### Loves what they do

Loving what you do activates your subconscious, and the subconscious is an incredibly powerful aid to doing great work. This is why many of the greatest discoveries seem to come from ["beyond"](https://eprints.iisc.ac.in/44657/1/cur_sci_102-9_1320_2012.pdf) a conscious process.

I believe you can't cultivate strong subconscious intuition without a certain degree of natural obsession that can only come by loving your craft. I want to work with people who derive a deep joy from doing what they do.

### Courageous

["Courage is in far shorter supply than genius"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_vDZqQgmeQ).

### Can concentrate

By ability to concentrate, I'm talking about the raw ability to set your mind on something for long periods of time (>= 20 mins) without chasing after a distraction. This is quickly becoming a rare skill.

A distracted mind has no space to think critically because it's constantly pulled by thoughts in many directions. Thinking for yourself requires sufficient concentration.

Even in situations that require switching between many things in quick succession, a concentrated mind gives you greater control over which distractions you allow your mind to go to and how long you keep it there.

Concentration is a muscle that can be trained, therefore when I see people without the ability to concentrate on something for long periods of time, it tells me:

- they don't prioritize this ability. (bad judgement).
- they don't know how to train their ability to concentrate. (bad judgement + incompetence because if they understood the value of this ability they would have obsessed over finding ways to train it).
- they're innately incapable of concentrating, perhaps due to some underlying biological cause.

Regardless of the reason, being unable to concentrate on something for long periods of time is too much of a handicap.

### Mentally balanced

Mental balance is a force multiplier for every aspect of the human experience. A calmer, less reactive mind makes better decisions, is happier, and can operate more effectively.

Mental balance increases endurance. The greatest drain on our energies is negative emotional reactions such as fear, anxiety, anger, etc. Calmer people can concentrate better and work for much longer periods of time without getting tired.

Mental balance helps us seek truth. Failure is caused by not seeing the truth: when we see what we want to see rather than see reality as it is, we act in ways that are mis-aligned with reality: building products no one wants, misunderstanding what someone is saying, etc.

Cultivating mental balance requires training combined with the right lifestyle.

The mind and body are deeply interconnected. How you treat the body reflects on your state of mind. Addictions of any kind destabilize the mind. Whereas regular exercise, a healthy diet, regular fasting, and channeling a [flow state](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>), cultivate mental balance.

I want to work with people who prioritize mental balance and are great at cultivating it.

### Has strong integrity

Damaging your reputation through dishonesty, cheating, fraud, manipulation is a symptom of a lack of ambition.

Someone who is ambitious knows that great work is long-term game and that having a strong reputation is incredibly important in order to garner support from others. They wouldn't risk damaging their reputation over some measly short-term gains.

I want to work with people I can trust, who say what they mean, who I know won't risk long-term outcomes for short-term gains by damaging our brand.

### Naturally talented

Each of us has a natural inclination towards ways of expressive ourselves and certain curiosities. Natural talent is the kind of skill that's aligned with your natural inclinations.

When your work is aligned with your natural inclinations, work becomes play, you become internally driven, and you can't help but obsess, leading to a sort of mastery that someone who isn't aligned with their natural inclinations can't hope to achieve.

It's easy to spot those who may be good at what they do, but don't have natural talent. They have to work harder. They have to push. They don't truly love what they do. They don't become one of the best.

Finding and cultivating natural talent requires self-awareness and courage.

The world is constantly pushing us to do things that are economically valuable, regardless of whether we have natural talent in those things, by dangling money and status in front of us. It takes courage to seek your natural inclinations, and to commit to them regardless of the short-term consequences in doing so.

I want to work with people who are naturally talented at what they do because only they have the potential to be great at what they do, and they inspire me to accept and double down on my own natural inclinations.

### Works hard

"Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard".

### All in

Doing too many things is a sign that someone hasn't discovered their natural talent, or isn't able to work with their natural talent due to financial needs. Someone who has found their natural talent wouldn't be able to pull themselves away from their work for such extended periods of time to give space for serious hobbies.

Being "all in" is partly a natural obsession that comes from doing what you love, as well as a deep commitment to your craft. Both are required to be great at what you do.

That being said, there are some kinds of highly creative work that's difficult to do for more than 5 - 8 hours a day. But, even in these cases, the creators wouldn't describe what they do during their downtime as a "hobby", but rather as a necessary recharge to be able to get back to what they love doing.

> "When you stop you are as empty, and at the same time never empty but filling, as when you have made love to someone you love. Nothing can hurt you, nothing can happen, nothing means anything until the next day when you do it again. It is the wait until the next day that is hard to get through.” - [Earnest Hemingway](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1064844-when-i-am-working-on-a-book-or-a-story).

I don't want to work with people who have serious hobbies outside of their work + core family & friends. By "serious" I mean hobbies that are planned in advance, that require training and commitment, can't be sacrificed if their main work demands it, and doesn't directly help them in their work.

Of course, there are some people who are working on multiple simultaneous projects, and can still do each exceptionally well. But, in those cases, what you'll usually find is that internally they're doing the same thing and it just looks like different things from the outside.

There are also people who do great work across many domains over the course of their lives, but at any given phase, we'd see that they were almost entirely occupied with one thing.

I acknowledge there will be exceptions, but I believe the exceptions are so rare that I'm willing to take the risk of passing up on people who aren't all in and are still capable of doing great work in order to save myself from working with the many who aren't all in and cannot do great work.

### Massive ego

Common hiring "wisdom" is to find people with "low egos".

What this means in practice is you'll get people who don't care enough about their work and will allow their ideas to be trampled by others even if they believe their ideas are better - i.e. people who prioritize not rocking the boat when the boat should in fact be rocked.

And it's not even that these people have "low ego". There's no such thing as "low ego". There are only a handful of people in the world that I'd characterize as having low or no ego, and they live in ways that you and I can't even comprehend. "Low ego" people are usually people with middling egos who likely lack the self-awareness to see their egos.

People with middling egos are poisonous. They'll settle for the measly prestige that comes from titles, promotions, raises, how many people they manage, etc.

I want to work with people with egos so large that they are fine being misunderstood and even villainized today as long as their work is celebrated in history books centuries later.

I want to work with people with egos so large that they rise above petty politics and status games because they know that the people who play such games won't even appear in footnotes.

I want to work with people with egos so large that they're paranoid about seeking truth and correcting their false beliefs because they know that "truth debt" will certainly cause failure in the long-run.

I want to work with people with egos so large that they're humble because they understand that humility is required to do the kind of work that moves the world forward.

I want to work with people with egos so large that if they believe that their views are too mis-aligned with mine, they'll quit and start their own competing company not necessarily out of spite, but because they can't help it: their egos require them to succeed massively, and they can't be stopped by anyone - including their teammates.

Ego is a unidirectional circle. Massive ego looks like "low ego" from the outside. You can only increase your ego. The path to dissolving the ego is escaping the circle altogether, which is a skill so rare that I don't believe anyone who says they have it. Therefore, I'm stuck trying to find people with massive egos.

### Notes

<Footnotes>

Naturally, my intuitions about the kind of person I want to work with are grounded in my beliefs about how to do great work & about the human condition. This essay isn't an attempt to explain why I believe what I do, or to convince anyone that this is a good way to determine who to work with. I'm simply stating what I'm looking for.

There's a lot of overlap between these qualities and they often emerge together. For example, it's only when you find what you're naturally talented at that you'll really love what you do, and you'll find it easier to concentrate, etc. Or that when you're more calm, your natural inclinations are more likely to present themselves than if you always try to force it.

I suspect I'll be editing this essay for many years to come. This is probably the highest leverage essay I'll ever write because who you choose to spend time with with is the highest leverage decision. It makes sense to think extremely deeply about this.
