Quality of the team is everything. I only want to work with people who are great. This essay is my attempt to define what I mean by that. 

Naturally, if I'm looking to work with people who are great, I'll need to be great as well. Therefore, this essay is also a personal north star: it defines the kind of person and teammate that I aspire to be.

I seek those with:

### Ambition

- Which mountain you choose to climb is as important, if not more, as how well you can climb the mountain.
- Ambition is more rare than talent. The world is full of people with incredible potential and capabilities who choose to settle.
- Ambition is agnostic 
- Overcoming schlep blindness

### Determination

Accomplishing anything worthwhile is difficult. People who do great work have the knack of sticking to a challenging problem no matter what.

### Limitlessness

All of us are limited by our identities to some degree. Someone who thinks of themselves as a "writer" tends to only see paths in life that reinforce that identity and will find it difficult to pursue opportunities that they don't see a "writer" doing.

This isn't a conscious process. Our subconscious quickly gets attached to 

I remember once I was talking to a "back-end" engineer about an idea for an app and they were hesitant to work on it with me because they didn't feel they had the "front-end" ability to be able to pull it off well. Limiting.

Many people also

Of course, it's easier to find limitations in others than it is to find it in ourselves. I'm quite limited as well. 

### Excellent communication

Effective communication IS effective thinking.

Excellent communication is one that can explain things simply, focus on what matters, and 

I care more about quality of writing than speaking (whether in front of an audience, or even in a team setting) because communicating well via speaking requires a set of skills that aren't necessary for thinking well. A great thinker can be a horrible speaker because they are shy, or their minds race too fast for their voice to keep up, or for many other reasons. But, there is no excuse for bad writing other than bad thinking.

By "bad thinking" I don't mean some innate inability to think well, but rather a lack of willingness to do so - because I believe

- (focus on written communication).
- I don't trust the thinking quality of people who can't can't communicate well.

### Mental balance

### Strong integrity

### Natural talent

### Work ethic

### Self awareness

### Good taste

### All in

### Massive ego

As I was writing this essay, I realized that I'm not seeking these qualities just in the people I work with, but also in anyone that I spend time with. We are deeply influenced by the people we spend time with because our minds are evolutionarily programmed to do so. Caring about the same things and prioritizing in the same ways as the tribe is what kept our ancestors alive. Thinking that we can override this deep conditioning just by wanting to is foolish. The only control we have is to be able to ruthlessly filter the kind of people we spend time with.
