Software services can be categorized 2 buckets: primitives and derivatives.

**primitives**: deeply technical services that provide new software primitives that enable you to manipulate some complex, messy, real world system through code, or enable a new function that most other companies can't build in-house because they lack the domain expertise.

examples:

- Stripe (primitives for commerce).
- OpenAI (provides a new function: AI)

**derivatives**: these are software services that are made out of a combination of other services. almost every software you can think of falls into this bucket. the innovation for derivatives is often in product design, positioning, marketing, sales, etc.

As software has eaten the world, the majority of software created has been derivative. This makes sense because there is a lot more opportunity in customizing / combining primitives and other derivatives to create services that fit the unique needs of various types of companies and use-cases.

As AI gets really good, it will be able to create any kind of derivative software instantaneously, with the best user experience (i.e. the experience of chatting with a highly intelligent human who understands you). AI will remove the need for most derivative software companies: i.e. the majority of software services today.

Primitives will continue to be exceptionally valuable because they are what enable AI to manipulate things in the world. We will see a rise in them because the range of primitives is the limiting factor for AI (i.e. each primitive is like a new "arm" for AI, enabling it to manipulate domains it was earlier incapable of).

That being said, there will still be a few derivative software services that thrive because they will excel at building community and building a brand that people like - even though the core product is derivative that AI can build in a second. And similarly others will exist because of network effects / social / some other angle that is independent of the core functionality of the software itself.

But, at the end of the day, I do think AI causes the death of the kind of software services that have defined the last couple of decades of software eating the world.
