### Overview

A personal token is a fictional entity that represents an individual's equity in two kinds of assets:

1. Equity in other personal tokens.
2. Equity in companies.

A user (Alice) can raise money from others in the network by selling equity in her personal token. This represents Alice giving up equity in her future outcomes in exchange for valuable capital today that would help Alice generate outcomes.

Over time, Alice will create value for herself and her investors by earning equity in companies by creating, working at, or investing in them, and also by earning equity in personal tokens by investing in them.

When Alice sells her equity in a personal token, or sells her equity in a company, a portion of the capital she gains goes to those who hold equity in Alice's personal token - proportional to how much equity they hold.

With such a personal token system, ambitious individuals can raise money by selling equity in their future outcomes. They can raise money much earlier in their learning journey, perhaps even years before they actually start their own company or work at one.

Examples:

Bob is a high schooler with a podcast in which he interviews people he finds interesting. He demonstrates a knack for asking the right questions & choosing interesting people to interview. Ryan, A famous podcaster recognizes that Bob may have a special talent and decides to invest $50k in Bob in exchange for a 3% equity in Bob's personal token.

Ryan is now incentivized to mentor Bob and help him succeed. Ryan creates wealth when Bob does. Bob can now afford to dedicate all of his time towards his podcast and will likely improve much faster than if he had to also get a part time to job to help him survive and invest in his podcast.

Amy is an undergrad researching nuclear power. She just published a paper that was met with a lukewarm reception at a popular conference, but caught the eye of Maya, a startup CEO building a nuclear power plant. Maya finds Amy's research promising and invests in Amy's personal token to enable Amy to follow her natural curiosity in her research without worrying about grants which she's struggling to get because the community doesn't quite value her research.

Maya doesn't consider her investment in Amy to be that risky because Maya is convinced that nuclear power will create incredible economic value within a couple of decades, and that the skills Amy will build through her research - regardless of how successful her current research direction is - will make Amy very wealthy, and therefore will make Maya wealthy.

We will need personal tokens to be able to democratize access to opportunity.

As AI becomes better, the power law distribution of outcomes will become more extreme (fewer will create most economic value) as AI rapidly makes our work more creative. It won't make sense for people to pay for education because most won't earn back their investment on a reasonable timeline, if ever. Raising venture capital by selling equity in personal tokens will be the best (and eventually, only) way to finance learning.

Personal tokens enables those with potential to gain access to valuable capital that they likely wouldn't have access to otherwise - regardless of background.
