As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful, our work will become more complex, creative, and will increasingly follow a power law distribution of outcomes: fewer will capture the majority of the outcomes. As outcomes become more skewed to the top, the median outcome will increasingly feel insufficient. Most people will not make enough.

In addition, contrary to popular opinion, as AI becomes more capable, the cost of education will increase, not decrease. Paying for education won't work because most won't earn back their investment on a reasonable timeline, if ever.

As the world becomes more creative and the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more skewed towards the top, venture capital (VC) - **putting money in the hands of individuals in exchange for a small ownership in the outcomes they generate (e.g. the companies they will create, or the assets they will own in the future)** - will be the best (and eventually only) way to finance learning.

Teachers, mentors, and educational institutes will monetize through VC.

### Creativity & power law

[Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity) is proportional to how many ways there are of doing something, or more technically speaking: how many possible states you can end up in. Assembling a chair on a factory line isn't that complex: there are only so many ways of doing it (often only one way). Creating a Youtube video is highly complex because there are too many possibilities to count.

The more complex a skill is, the more creative you need to be to become good at it, and the greater the difference between those who are great at it, and the rest.

The power law distribution (a few contribute most of the outcomes) dominates all creative fields:

There is no "middle class" for creative skills. If you make it, you make it big, else you struggle to get by. The greater the outcomes for the best, the lower the median outcome.

When I first observed that the median outcome falls as the power law becomes more extreme, I was surprised because it made it seem that the world was zero-sum: someone creating more value meant that they took it from someone else. But I also knew that these creative fields were positive sum: their overall markets have been [growing rapidly](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/the-creator-economy-could-approach-half-a-trillion-dollars-by-2027). The pie is undeniably getting bigger. Creators make more money overall. So what's going on?

What we consider "good enough" is constantly recalibrating. When new products that radically improve how we live are invented (e.g. smartphones, internet, cars, antibiotics, etc.), we quickly begin to see them as necessities rather than luxuries. Even though the average person today can afford what used to be luxuries in previous times [1], it never feels good enough because our standards recalibrate to want more. New products are created & distributed faster than ever before, and we're aware of them more quickly than ever before through the internet, so the rate at which our desires recalibrate is faster than ever before.

For example, I'm writing this from a remote village in the mountains in India. People here have water heaters, smartphones, fast data, small tractors, sprinklers, and motorcycles. Many of the older people living in this village see these tools as luxuries that they could live without if they needed to, whereas the younger people see them as necessities to such a degree that living without them almost feels inhumane. Our tendency to recalibrate our expectations is perhaps why we're so hungry to innovate. Our dissatisfaction is a feature, not a bug.

In addition to this constant recalibration, there is still some element "taking from others". When people switch towards using new products, the ones they switched away from do lose revenue. This also applies to content as well: when I find a new content creator covering the same topic as someone I already follow but in a way I find better, I'm more likely to switch over completely because I don't have time to watch both.

There's also a notion of degree to the power law: how "skewed" it is towards the top. This seems to be a function of:

- complexity (number of possibilities)
- leverage (how quickly you can create something)
- number of creators
- size of the market (i.e. how much value can you create with this skill. The more value you can create, the more intense the competition, and the more skewed the power law).

Even if the world was fair and there was equal access to opportunity and resources, we would still see great inequality of outcomes because the power law distribution is an inevitable feature of creative work. They're like two sides of the same coin: inseparable.

The power law exists everywhere we look. For example, even amongst professional players of board games like [Go](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)>), and [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess), there is a power law distribution of relative ability. It's difficult to claim that the best players, who are much better than the average professionals, only became that great due to some sort of unfair advantage (resources, mentorship, etc.). The reality is that many of the world's greatest players today have had quite similar access to resources at young ages: great computers to train with, and attended reputed training programs run by some of the best players. Yet, we find a power law distribution of relative ability that is proportional to how complex the skill is. Go is more complex than Chess, and hence, Go has as more skewed power law distribution of ability amongst top players:

<ChessVsGo />

Outcomes _can_ be forced to be equal through an external force such as a government deciding that no one can make more or less than anyone else. But, the underlying power law distribution of _productivity_ cannot be eliminated unless you make our work far less complex and creative. If all of us could only do simple work such as assembling things on a factory line, sure, the difference in our productivity wouldn't be that great. But, that is a regression that most of us wouldn't want even if we think we might.

**The power law is inevitable for creative skills. We ought to design a future that takes this truth into account in the same way we ought to take into account gravity when designing airplanes.**

### All work will be creative

AI will eventually make all of our work highly complex and creative.

AI will take longer to impact physical work because it takes longer to build and scale robots than it is to do work in the digital realm. But, in knowledge work, AI will rapidly make all our work highly creative, and therefore, the power law distribution of outcomes for all knowledge work will rapidly become very skewed - proportional to how powerful AI is.

To see why, let's take the example of software engineering. Software is a great domain to study because it's the fastest growing college major, and because those who create software are usually the first to adopt new technologies such as AI in their work. Seeing how AI has changed software engineering will give us a glimpse of how AI will change all knowledge work.

Before AI, the majority of actual software engineering work was only moderately creative. Anyone who's built software applications before large language models knows just how much grunt work there is to turn an idea into reality. The majority of code written was "glue code": code used to connect together different software services to make it do what you want. Even a simple idea for an app would take weeks of grinding through mostly grunt work to actually bring it to life.

Now, with the latest AI models (OpenAI's o1 / Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5), AI can do most of the grunt work for us. Now, an engineer spends more time on more creative work: on the system architecture, deciding which external services to use and why, and on product decisions like figuring out what to build. An engineer would only need to drop down into less creative work in the cases that AI fails. Working on higher level architecture and product decisions is far more creative than writing glue code because there are many, many more possibilities in how you can do it.

What will happen when each engineer has access to AI coding models that are 10x more capable than the current ones? What happens when each engineer has access to a near infinite number of reasonably capable, always-on, fast, teammates they can instruct as if they were instructing junior teammates? What happens when you can give an AI a detailed spec of the software you want built, and some design inspirations to help guide its style, and it does a great job at implementing it? An engineer's work becomes even more creative: they'll focus more on product and business decisions: figuring out what to build and why, while only jumping down into technical details only when the AI fails.

In other words as AI becomes more capable, engineers will require the same skillset as startup founders. And we know just how creative that is, and just how extreme the power law distribution of productivity is for that: most aren't good enough. Most fail.

There are early signs that this shift is well underway. As engineering is becoming more creative, coding bootcamps [are going broke](https://x.com/gergelyorosz/status/1732876403626926300). More companies are hiring engineers the way you hire a creative: based on their portfolio, conversations and referrals alone without any kind of standardized exam (which doesn’t work for creative skills). And junior engineers / new grads no longer have job opportunities because the baseline talent required is much higher than ever before; i.e. the less creative work no longer exists.

It's easy to see how a similar evolution will happen for all knowledge work. Designers who spend time tweaking layout properties in their design software will now spend more time on defining the brand, product, understanding users and crafting a compelling vision. Marketers who spend a lot of time implementing their marketing campaigns, will now spend more time understanding and optimizing for the incredibly complex and changing desires of their customers.

The power law distribution of productivity will become un-imaginably skewed. The best engineers, marketers, designers, or any role that we will invent, will be many, many orders of magnitude more productive than the average ones. And those who aren't one of the best, will struggle to make what they would consider to be enough.

### Inequality of opportunity

The power law distribution of outcomes is inevitable in a world in which all of our work is highly complex and creative. Therefore, we shouldn't treat inequality of outcomes as a problem. A highly complex and creative world in which everyone has equal access to opportunity will _still_ have very unequal outcomes: an extreme power law distribution that is skewed towards the top. But, it will be different than an unfair world because it will:

1. have no correlation between the circumstances of someone's birth and their eventual outcomes in life.
2. be dynamic: there will be a lot change in who is at the top vs. the bottom (high mobility)

Our greatest challenge will be to ensure equal access to opportunity such that anyone who has the talent and inclination to become great at something has access to all the resources they need.

Many seem to believe that AI will democratize access to opportunity by making quality education available to all, cheaply. Yet, AI will actually _increase_ the cost of education and make quality education more scarce. When AI can teach you a skill well, it means that the AI can also do it. When AI can do something well, the world won't pay people to do it. Humans will be pushed to do the work that AI cannot do - which will rapidly become more complex and creative proportional to how much of the less creative work AI can do for us.

But, the more complex a skill is, the more expensive education for it becomes because there are fewer teachers who are good enough at it, and greater demand for those teachers. This is because quality of teaching also follows the power law distribution: the more skewed results are towards the top, the fewer great teachers there are for that skill, and the more impactful the great teachers are compared to the average ones.

For example, many can teach high school math reasonably well, or how to assemble a product on a factory line, but very few can teach how to build great companies, write well enough to make a living from it, make films, etc. because these skills are highly complex / creative.

At the same time there will be much greater demand for the fewer great teachers because as the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more skewed to the top, people will be willing to pay a lot more to increase their probability of being one of the best.

Greater demand & fewer great teachers, means that a great teacher's time will be worth far more than ever before. As AI becomes more powerful, demand for great teachers will increase, average teachers will be ignored, and there will be less great teachers (because the bar for what is "great" rises sharply). Soon, only a few will be able to afford to pay great teachers what they're worth.

For example, those most qualified at teaching entrepreneurship are the ones that institutions cannot afford because their time is far too valuable. As all of our work becomes highly creative, the best teachers of software engineering, marketing, content creation, etc. will similarly become unaffordable to pay up front for their knowledge.

The only way to make it worthwhile for best teachers to teach anyone with talent - not just the richest who can pay them enough - will be to give them some sort of equity in the outcomes of those who they teach.

Without the ability for teachers to invest in their students in exchange for equity in their outcomes, those who come from wealth will disproportionately benefit from advances in AI because they will be the only ones who can afford the best education.

### Venture capital

Venture capital is a form of financing for risky, high-potential projects. Investors give companies money to enable them to accelerate building their product, in exchange for some ownership in the company itself.

Investors know many of their investments will fail, but they bet that the few massive successes will more than make up for the losses. For example, an investor might invest in ten startups knowing that seven might fail completely, two might return their money, but one might become the next big thing and generate returns thousands of times greater than their initial investment.

This model works particularly well for financing things that follow power law distributions - where a small number of winners capture most of the value. Traditional financing, like bank loans, works best when outcomes follow a normal distribution (bell curve) where most borrowers can repay their loans with modest success. Venture capital is designed specifically for situations where outcomes are highly skewed - where most attempts generate little value, but a few generate enormous value. This is why venture capital has been so successful in technology, where a single breakthrough product can capture an entire market globally.

An ambitious high schooler today, instead of going to college, can directly start a company and create something the world wants. They can directly generate revenue and / or raise money from investors for their project. There’s a growing number of young people pursuing this path, some with great success. As AI becomes more powerful and it becomes quicker and cheaper to create products, we should see many start companies at much younger ages.

But, requiring individuals to start companies in order to be able to raise money is limiting. Starting a company typically requires the founders to have at least a rough idea of the problem they’re tackling, how they’re going to do it, and competence - else it’s difficult for an investor to put money in their hands.

Yet, developing an idea and competence can take some time. Some incredibly valuable paths require more exploration before you have an angle to pursue. For example, Charles Darwin required extensive exploration and study of nature before he found his breakthrough. Darwin was partly financially supported by his family during the early stages of his career, which allowed him the freedom to thoroughly explore his natural curiosities. Meanwhile, many other potential Darwins were stuck plowing fields and doing work to survive that prevented them from following their natural curiosities and contributing to the world.

Also, not everyone with great talent will want to start a company. Many who can do great work will want to join great companies rather than start one themselves.

**Therefore, we need a way for individuals with potential to be able to raise money - regardless of when (or whether) they start a company.**

### Personal token

As a thought experiment, let's say we have the following system:

1. A fictional entity called a "personal token" ( <PersonalToken name="BOB" /> ) that represents all of Bob's assets: the companies and the physical & digital assets that he owns.
2. Someone (Alice) can buy ownership in <PersonalToken name="BOB" /> such that Alice indirectly owns a percentage of Bob's assets.
3. With Bob's permission, Alice can share her ownership in <PersonalToken name="BOB" /> to someone else.

Similar to a regular company, determining the value of <PersonalToken name="BOB" /> before an individual has created anything is more art than science because it is based on the individual's potential to earn over the long-run. Even if Bob has zero assets now, if enough people believe in Bob's potential, 1% equity in <PersonalToken name="BOB" /> could be worth tens of thousands of dollars or more. By selling stake in his personal token, Bob trades some of his future wealth for useful capital today which would help enable him to generate that future wealth.

Let's say Bob is young, ambitious and has shown early talent for designing products. Bob wants to spend his time tinkering and honing his craft. Bob would then raise money by giving up some equity in <PersonalToken name="BOB" />. If a handful of people (or even just one) believe that over the course of the next couple of decades Bob will do great work that will create tremendous value, they'd accept Bob's trade and give him capital in exchange for shares in <PersonalToken name="BOB" />. Bob gets capital to fuel his tinkering and experimentation.

Without this ability to raise money without starting a company, Bob would be forced to finance his own learning until he is good enough to join a great company or start one. Most don't have the wealth to be able to do this and would have to work other jobs to support exploring their natural curiosities and ambitions. This is a terrible waste of potential for both the individual and society, and disproportionately penalizes those who don't come from means.

VC is a much better way to finance learning becuase:

#### 1. VC scales.

Why can't we just rely on grants (e.g. [Thiel fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/), [Emergent ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures)) and scholarships to provide opportunity to those who may not have the means to pursue it?

Unfortunately, grants and scholarships don't scale because they rely on goodwill, not on the greed. VC rewards those who allocate resources to the right individuals. The greed for profit will increase the amount of capital flowing to young people by orders of magnitude because greed pulls more people into participating in betting on individuals.

**Greed scales**.

**Greed is reliable**. We can bet on greed existing in the world as strongly as we can bet on the sun rising tomorrow.

**Greed is robust**. People will invest in companies and individuals with potential no matter how bad the market gets.

#### 2. VC aligns incentives.

When Alice invests in Bob, it's in Alice's best interest to help Bob succeed because Alice only profits if Bob does as well. Alice is incentivized to help Bob succeed however she can: mentorship, connecting to her network, etc.

On the other hand, institutions that charge up front to teach don't have a strong forcing function to ensure that their students actually do well. Even if most students don't do well, it'll take years for an institute's poor performance to impact their bottom line. There are many colleges who have had abysmal outcomes for their students over the past couple of years that still have full enrollment right now.

#### 3. VC will be the only way to afford the best teachers.

As the power law distribution of outcomes becomes more skewed, the best teachers will be far too expensive for any institution to be able to hire them. No business school can afford Elon Musk or Paul Graham to teach. No computer science program will be able to afford the best software engineers. No design school will be able to afford the best designers.

The best teachers will teach for free in exchange for equity in personal tokens.

We would see engineering / design schools run similar to how startup accelerators are run: those accepted are **paid to join** and learn from great mentors and peers, in exchange for small equity in their outcomes. There will be no need to pay to learn.

#### 4. VC incentivizes distributing knowledge freely.

When the best teachers can directly invest in their students' outcomes, many will share all of their knowledge to the world for free as marketing to attract students to them because their wealth will come from their students' outcomes, rather than by charging up front for their knowledge (which fewer people will be able to pay for).

For example, if Paul Graham didn't share his knowledge about how to build startups with the world through his blog, it's unlikely that YCombinator (one of the top startup accelerators) would have been able to attract the quality of founders it did early on. Sharing knowledge freely is a valuable form of marketing.

Soon (when our world reaches a certain inflection point in the power law distribution of outcomes), only mediocre teachers will be the ones putting their knowledge behind a paywall, because if they could actually impact a student's outcomes, they'd make far more money by making their knowledge free, attracting students to them for personalized feedback and investing in them. Charging money up front will be a sign that they can't actually improve a student's chances of becoming great at what they do.

#### 5. VC will democratize opportunity.

Greed will drive investors to discover and enable talent regardless of background. A budding content creator in rural Alabama, a high schooler in inner city Baltimore with a strong aptitude for engineering, or an affluent child in a Bay Area suburb with talent for design would all be sought after by investors.

It will still take time for opportunity to be truly democratized. Those who don't come from sufficient wealth will continue to be underrepresented for a while because they are less likely to have the environment to nurture and express their innate talents. For example: a child with great potential who grows up in a violent neighborhood with parents who neglect them will find it much more difficult to nurture their talents. As a result, fewer investors would be willing to take a bet on them.

Yet, VC creates the economic incentives to improve the lives of all children. When there is less childhood trauma and poverty, more people can nurture their talents, creating a larger market opportunity for investors. On the other hand, without the ability to invest in individuals, there's actually an incentive to keep people in poverty: they're an easy vote bank to cater to.

With the ability to invest in individuals, we should see a lot more capital flowing towards creating better environments for children living in poverty and danger in order to enable more individuals that can create value in the world, and therefore can be invested in. Investors who allocate capital towards poor communities would have the opportunity to invest in the talent that comes from those communities in the future. While many say they want to do this today, we see little progress (and investment into communities) because there is no direct reward for doing so. Greed scales in ways goodwill cannot.

Of course, it's possible there's a natural limit to how much we can make access to opportunity truly equal. Some may always have inbuilt, genetic, advantage over others that makes it easier for them to thrive. For example, those who have a natural curiosity for storytelling will do much better than those who are naturally inclined towards, say, underwater basket weaving. Regardless, we ought to figure out what that limit is. Enabling investing in individuals through VC will help us figure out what the limit is and discover just how "equal" we all actually are.

---

Of course, there are concerns.

Those who investors don't want to invest in will need some sort of basic income [2]. We'll also need a good way to minimize fraud. And we'll likely need to work harder to maintain our mental health because we're not evolutionarily wired to handle such drastic inequality of outcomes. No amount of basic income will satiate our craving to be useful to society, and yet most are bound to "fail" at creating meaningful economic value [3]. These realities will be difficult to accept for most of us.

Regressing, by eliminating AI advancements that make our work more complex & creative, is stupid because the benefits of AI will far outweigh the negatives.

We have no choice but to adapt & [personal tokens](/personal-token) will be an important piece of the puzzle. If you're interested in exploring this with me, [please reach out](https://x.com/saltykarthik).

### Notes

<Footnotes>

[1] Median real (inflation-adjusted) household income in USA is at an [all time high](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N), and yet we feel we have less than ever before. Our expectations are higher perhaps due to the greater inequality and easy access to the lives of those who have it better than we do.

[2] Even basic income can be implemented as a form of investment. Each individual receives some money from the collective in exchange for giving up some equity of their assets to the collective - such that each person holds equity in every other person’s (who is in the same country or network) outcomes. They could even trade their equities in others in a marketplace. This would enable each of us to feel direct ownership in the success of others. One of the greatest cultural challenges we’ll need to deal with is how the rising inequality of outcomes creates a hateful us vs. them dynamic. If each person had direct equity in those that do end up becoming quite wealthy, it may lead to a more cohesive society in which there’s less hatred for those who create a lot of value because it directly benefits each of us. Taxing the wealthy and funneling it back to people through government spending sounds like the same thing, but it’s far from it. When those taxes are funneled through a government bureaucracy and little of it, if any, arrives in the hands of the average citizen, we don’t feel any sense of ownership over the success of the winners.

[3] At least over the course of this decade.
